  <h1>OT-Microservices</h1>
</div>

A loaded microservice applications for doing different kinds of POC. This is a sample Employee System which is designed to understand the microservices nature and behaviour.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this application is to provide an individual, a holistic idea of microservice architecture, it's working, and its setup.

## Applications

These are few microservices which are getting used in this complete project.

|**Application Name**|**Default Port**|**Dependency**|**Description**|
|--------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| [attendance](./attendance) | 8081 | MySQL | Attendance is a microservice which is designed in Golang to manage employee's attendance information. |
| [employee](./employee) | 8083 | Elasticsearch | Employee microservice is also designed in Golang to manage employee's information. |
| [salary](./salary) | 8082 | Elasticsearch | Salary is also a golang based application which creates and manages employee's salary information. |
| [frontend](./frontend) | 5000 | Gateway | Frontend is written in ReactJS and gets served using nginx proxy, config can be found [here](./webserver) |
| [gateway](./gateway) | 8080 | <ul><li>attendance</li><li>employee</li><li>salary</li></ul> | Gateway is a springboot based API gateway which manages the routing between applications. |
| [webserver](./webserver) | 80 | frontend | Webserver is a nginx based proxy which proxies the frontend application. |

## Databases

These applications are using two kinds of databases, one is structured and other is non-structured.

|**Application Name**|**Default Port**|**Dependency**|**Description**|
|--------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| [elastic](./elastic) | 9092 | - | Elasticsearch is being used as non-structured database which manages the employee's information and salary. |
| [mysql](./mysql) | 3306 | - | MySQL is getting used for structured database which manages the employee's attendance information. |
